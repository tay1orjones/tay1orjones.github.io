The Allied Arts Council of St. Joseph, MO needed a new site for their new Arts Fund Endowment, as well as a logo. 

I first started off with the logo. The logo needed to work well in a web and print context, and provide meaning in relation to the endowment. Early on, I decided on a circular mark to convey the continuity of the endowment. The endowment will serve as a source of funds for the arts community in St. Joseph, MO for generations. Money given today will be reciprocated for years to come, providing opportunities, events, and experiences for the next generation of donators. Overlapping and mixing colors show the endowment to be a representation of the eclectic arts community coming together as one to provide arts experiences for generations to come. The slight gradiental progression in color around the circle helps to tie together these two ideas - connectedness within the community, and the reciprocal circle of donations. The typeface needed to convey a sophistication that coincides with generational giving, but also provide a youthful attitude for the events and organizations supported by the endowment. Typefaces also needed to preferably be free, as the AAC operates on a strict and tight budget. I settled on a blend of two typefaces, [PT Serif](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Serif) to convey the sophistication, and [Raleway](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway) to convey the youthful attitude of today.

For the website, I leared early on that the Allied Arts Council (AAC) uses Microsoft Expressions for all of their websites. It's a tool that's a bit outdated, but the AAC requested that the site had to be manageable through this interface. Using Foundation 5, I created the site statically first, and then moved it over into expressions. The site utilizes the templating structure of Expressions, as well as includes. The site is fully responsive to help the content be digestable on any device. Presently, the site is a little light on content, although as the breadth of information around the endowment grows, the site will too.
