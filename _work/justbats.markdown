I currently work for [Pro Athlete, Inc.](http://www.proathleteinc.com/), an eCommerce company that specializes in the sale of baseball and softball bats/gloves through JustBats.com and JustBallGloves.com. As a front end programmer, I develop new features for JustBats.com, JustBallGloves.com and the company website using responsive, mobile-first, DRY coding techniques. We create, improve and maintain internal web services and platforms including an in-house CMS/Inventory management system and various data visualizations. My teammates and I utilize meetings, customer review, estimation, code review, and architecture review processes to make sure all new developments have been scoped accordingly, designed appropriately, and developed to specification within agile methodologies. We use github enterprise for source control management.
